        <h1>Treasure Island</h1>
        <p>
            Many have heard the tale of Ol' Willy Russell and his buried treasure!<br>
            The tale goes that Willy landed on treasure island and walked for leagues<br>
            to find a place for his spoils.<br>

            After years of searching ye've found yerself washed up on it's cursed shores<br>
            can ye follow in the footsteps of Ol' Willy and find his fabled riches?
        </p>
        <p>
            Looks like you forgot how to walk with them sea legs!<br>
            Use yer arrow keys to move around the island and you<br>
            can use the space bar to dig up a patch of land to check for treasure<br>

        <br>
            Be careful though, I reckon that spade's only got about 25 digs left<br>
            in it before you're left on the island with nothing!
